Do you think that slavery being objectively bad is unrealistic? Do you want to emulate company towns and other buisnesses where employees aren't paid with cash? Do you want to make Debt Slavery meta? Welcome to Industrial Slavery! This mod allows slaves to work in industrial workplaces while making minor edits to slaves to make them more equatible to workers. This won't make slavery broken since no changes outside of them working are made. Likewise, slaves [i]tend[/i] to be unhappier than workers, as well as dragging down your literacy, making research more difficult. Employ slaves at your own risk, but now you can employ them everywhere. 

Enjoy!
