First Economic mod for Vicky 3, this mod aims to fix some economic issues and realism issues that Vicky 3 suffers from. The primary changes of this mod include:
Prices range from 1%-199% of base price (most variation we can have thanks to the defines)
Min price is $0 (although it will not actually ever reach this technically)
Economy of scale realistically never caps
Total Good shortages will prevent production
Min wage can now be as low as Â£0.01
Max wage increase can now be 100% of current wage
Buildings can increase wages after the first week, instead of first two weeks
Enjoy!
